        This is a demo application for Maoni, a lightweight library which provides
        a ready-to-use Material-ized activity for collecting user feedbacks from within an existing app.
        \n
        Unlike other similar libraries, Maoni allows to capture a screenshot of the current activity,
        which you may manipulate in your callbacks.
        \n\n
        Touch the Floating Action Button below to open the Maoni activity.
        \n\n
        Please navigate to http://github.com/rm3l/maoni for further instructions.
